Pre Course Capstone Project: Build a Wordle Clone
Tutorial link - https://realpython.com/python-wordle-clone/#step-2-use-a-word-list
My code is slightly different to the one on tutorial 

On the main branch, the basic wordle clone game works
Created a "using_rich" branch and started to use Rich to style my game and followed the tutorial "Step 4: Style Your Game With Rich"
Currently stuck on the "Keep Track of Previous Guesses and Color Them" section of this step
